# Riverbraid Safety-Gold
[ARCHITECTURE.md Spec](https://github.com/Riverbraid/Riverbraid-Golds/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Signal: INVARIANT_SAFETY
This petal enforces deterministic ethical boundaries. It operates as a fail-closed gate; if a safety invariant cannot be verified with 100% certainty, the system halts. 

### Core Responsibilities
- Deterministic boundary enforcement.
- Real-time invariant monitoring.
- Zero-entropy safety gating.
